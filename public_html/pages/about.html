      <h1>Population Fluidity</h1>

        <u>Problem Statement:</u> How will policy makers and government officals
        know what to make in 10 years?
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the fluidity of population size is key to establishing
        proper infrastructure to maintain a healthy and happy community. Our
        goal is to info Government officials and policymakers about population
        patterns in their juristiction so they can make infrastructure decisions
        to meet the needs of their people. The purpose would be to illustrate
        the source of the population growth or shrinking and help them be
        informed and prepared for building infrastructure, housing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building the correct infrastructure to support the population is a
        challenging task. With too little, the community struggles to thrive
        while having too much is a waste of time and resources. One example of
        this is the empty city in China, Kangbashi in Ordos, Inner Mongolia.
        Kangbashi was built to hold a million people, yet only 30,000 live there
        and the properties are beginning to lose value. Compared to areas with
        failing infrastructure, such as the Brent Spence Bridge in Cincinnati
        that is failing and does not meet the needs of the communityâ€™s
        transportation needs. In both cases, it is pertinent that people have
        the services they need to build a community with transportation, jobs,
        and housing for the community to grow. Any shortcomings result in
        bottlenecks and stunted economic development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a difficult task to plan for but working on understanding the
        size of the population and demographics can help us plan years in
        advance to try to meet future needs. An insight that a user would have
        is that in this region, say Nevada, the population has been increasing
        at a rate of 10% where most of the migrants are from California. Over
        the last five years, this percentage has grown and looks to continue
        growing as the cost of living continues to increase. Therefore it is
        impertinent to the success of Nevada that there are enough houses and
        jobs to continue this influx from California.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visualization would offer an overview of the migration that occurs
        throughout the United States by coloring each individual state to
        represent whether the inbound or outbound migration was larger. Zooming
        in, there would be a heatmap county level analysis that displays the net
        migration of each county as the next granular level. The data comes from
        the US Census Bureau Geographic Mobility from 2015 to 2020. This data
        contains estimates for total population sizes for each year by state and
        where they resided a year ago.
