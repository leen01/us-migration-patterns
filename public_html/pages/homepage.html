          <u>Problem Statement:</u> How will policy makers and government
          officals know what to make in 10 years?
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the fluidity of population size is key to establishing
          proper infrastructure to maintain a healthy and happy community. Our
          goal is to info Government officials and policymakers about population
          patterns in their juristiction so they can make infrastructure
          decisions to meet the needs of their people. The purpose would be to
          illustrate the source of the population growth or shrinking and help
          them be informed and prepared for building infrastructure, housing,
          etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building the correct infrastructure to support the population is a
          challenging task. With too little, the community struggles to thrive
          while having too much is a waste of time and resources. One example of
          this is the empty city in China, Kangbashi in Ordos, Inner Mongolia.
          Kangbashi was built to hold a million people, yet only 30,000 live
          there and the properties are beginning to lose value. Compared to
          areas with failing infrastructure, such as the Brent Spence Bridge in
          Cincinnati that is failing and does not meet the needs of the
          communityâ€™s transportation needs. In both cases, it is pertinent that
          people have the services they need to build a community with
          transportation, jobs, and housing for the community to grow. Any
          shortcomings result in bottlenecks and stunted economic development.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a difficult task to plan for but working on understanding the
          size of the population and demographics can help us plan years in
          advance to try to meet future needs. An insight that a user would have
          is that in this region, say Nevada, the population has been increasing
          at a rate of 10% where most of the migrants are from California. Over
          the last five years, this percentage has grown and looks to continue
          growing as the cost of living continues to increase. Therefore it is
          impertinent to the success of Nevada that there are enough houses and
          jobs to continue this influx from California.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visualization would offer an overview of the migration that occurs
          throughout the United States by coloring each individual state to
          represent whether the inbound or outbound migration was larger.
          Zooming in, there would be a heatmap county level analysis that
          displays the net migration of each county as the next granular level.
          The data comes from the US Census Bureau Geographic Mobility from 2015
          to 2020. This data contains estimates for total population sizes for
          each year by state and where they resided a year ago.
